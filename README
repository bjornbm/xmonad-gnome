I took the following steps to add a Xmonad-GNOME session to the login screen in Ubuntu:

1. Copy xmonad-gnome to /usr/bin.
2. Copy xmonad-gnome.desktop to /usr/share/xsessions.
3. Set gnome-wm as default window manager for gnome-session.
4. For the above to "stick" it seemed I had to force the first usage of xmonad by killing the running metacity and running xmonad.

Code:

sudo cp usr/bin/xmonad-gnome /usr/bin
sudo cp usr/share/xsessions/xmonad-gnome.desktop /usr/share/xsessions
gconftool --type string --set /desktop/gnome/session/required_components/windowmanager gnome-wm
killall metacity && xmonad

Other good stuff:

1. Don't use Nautilus desktop. 
   gconftool-2 --type boolean --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop false
2. Swap left alt and win key, use win key (mod4Mask) as xmonad mod key.
   This setup gives reasonable ergonomy for xmonad while keeping left alt.
3. Ignore gnome-do with a ManageHook.


GRUB menu
=========
1. Edit /etc/default/grub to remove hidden timeout.
2. Regenerate /boot/grub/grub.cfg by running `sudo update-grub`.

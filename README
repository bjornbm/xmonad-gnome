I took the following steps to add a Xmonad-GNOME session to the login screen in Ubuntu:

1. Copy xmonad-gnome to /usr/bin.
2. Copy xmonad-gnome.desktop to /usr/share/xsessions.
3. Set gnome-wm as default window manager for gnome-session.
4. For the above to "stick" it seemed I had to force the first usage of xmonad by killing the running metacity and running xmonad.

Code:

sudo cp xmonad-gnome         /usr/bin
sudo cp xmonad-gnome.desktop /usr/share/xsessions
gconftool --type string --set /desktop/gnome/session/required_components/windowmanager gnome-wm
killall metacity && xmonad
